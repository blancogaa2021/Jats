# PatchR.cmake patches some of the paths and values in `bin/R` and `etc/Makeconf`.
#
# A few things happen here,
#   In bin/R,
#     - Setting the R_HOME_DIR, and some of its dependent paths, e.g., R_SHARED_DIR.
#     - Setting the path to LIBR, this is going to be the path to `R.framework`
#     - On arm64 arch, replacing `/opt/R/arm64/` with `R_HOME/opt/R/arm64`
#     - On x86_64 arch, replacing `/usr/local/` with `R_HOME/usr/local`
#     - Changing the absolute symlinks of `R_HOME/fontconfig/fonts/conf.d` to relative symlinks.
#       This is one of the reason for broken notarization.
#     - Modifying the R.framework/Info.plist
#     - and removing bunch of stuff that could break the notarization
#
#
#
# WARNING:
#
#   When updating to a new R, we need to make sure that this script makes sense and it could
#   still manage to prepare a portable `R.framework`.
