		<p>
			​JASP is a cross platform statistical software program with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. 
			It offers standard analysis procedures in both	their classical and Bayesian form. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It was designed with the user in mind: APA-formatted tables can be copy-pasted in your word processor, output can be extensively annotated, adjustment of input options dynamically changes the output, and selecting 
			old output revives the associated input choices for inspection and adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>
			JASP is also statistically inclusive, as it offers both frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods. 
			Indeed, the primary motivation for JASP is to make it easier for statistical practitioners to conduct Bayesian analyses.

- Factor/CFA
  - Option to fix intercepts to zero in mean structure (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2223)

Implements some explainable modelling ('XAI') features from the DALEX package
    - After model performance, implemented an option in all supervised analyses to show feature importance metrics (via https://ema.drwhy.ai/featureImportance.html).
