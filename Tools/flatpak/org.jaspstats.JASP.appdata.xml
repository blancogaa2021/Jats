		<p>
			​JASP is a cross platform statistical software program with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. 
			It offers standard analysis procedures in both	their classical and Bayesian form. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It was designed with the user in mind: APA-formatted tables can be copy-pasted in your word processor, output can be extensively annotated, adjustment of input options dynamically changes the output, and selecting 
			old output revives the associated input choices for inspection and adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>
			JASP is also statistically inclusive, as it offers both frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods. 
			Indeed, the primary motivation for JASP is to make it easier for statistical practitioners to conduct Bayesian analyses.

JASP Release Notes 0.16.3
New features and improvements
* New Module: Quality Control.
* New Module: Bayesian State Space Models.
* New analysis added: Frequentist/ Classical Generalized Linear Model to the Regression module (#1656).
* ANOVA:
   * Bayesian ANOVA, Bayesian ANCOVA, and Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA (#151)
      * The value for the r-scale of the prior distribution on the coefficients can now be set individually for fixed effects.
      * The principle of marginality can be violated individually for fixed effects and random slopes. By default it is respected for fixed effects and violated for random slopes.
      * The prior on the model space can now be adjusted. Possible options are Uniform (default), Beta binomial, Wilson, Castillo, Bernoulli, and Custom. Custom allows for specifying individual inclusion probabilities for each effect. Note that the inclusion probabilities for interactions change if the principle of marginality is violated.

   * Improved part and partial correlations (#1638).
* T-Tests
   * Coefficient of variation added to the descriptives tables of all T-Tests (#122, #1599).
* Bain:
   * Draw correct posterior probability plot in all AN(C)OVA / regression / SEM situations (#80)
* Descriptives:
   * Improved interface (#1635)

* Reliability:
   * Krippendorff's alpha added to Rater Agreement (#1665).
   * Improvements to fit measure table for Bayesiansingle factor model (#94).
