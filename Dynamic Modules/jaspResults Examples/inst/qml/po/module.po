"This example shows two strategies to writing a jaspResults analysis.\n"
"Strategy one uses a classic R approach: compute a model, then pass it along "
"to every function.\n"
"Stratey two uses an unorthodox approach: computing the model when it's "
"actually required\n"
"and relying on pass-by-reference mechanics to get it to all functions that "
"need it.\n"
"This is accomplished by using containers\n"
"\n"
"The second approach has the benefit that passing errors is easier, "
"dependencies are shared (and\n"
"an empty table is always shown while the model is computing).\n"
"\n"
"Checking `We are ready` emulates the analysis being ready to compute and "
"show results.\n"
"Checking `Use the container code` forces the analysis to use strategy two "
"(otherwise it uses one).\n"
"Checking `Optional table` creates an optional table (as analyses often have "
"optional elements).\n"
"Checking `A random dependency` emulates a dependency change that forces a "
"recompute.\n"
"Checking `Generate computation error` forces an error to occur in the "
"compution phase."
