Advanced Preferences
=========

With these advanced parameters in JASP you can specify the following options.
(All these settings will remain after restarting JASP.)

### Use PPI (Pixels pre inch) of screen in plots

This is where you specify the number of pixels per inch of screen
to render your plots.

### Use interface scaling

This number specifies how the JASP interface will be scaled.
All menus and results are scaled by this factor.
You can alse use the keyboard shortcuts Cmd +/- (MacOS) or Ctrl +/- (Windows) for
this purpose.


### Image Background Color

The background color of images in JASP results can be influenced with this option.
This is especially important when copying and/or pasting plots.


### Developer Mode (Beta version)

This is where you specify if you want to use JASP modules or not.
A location folder can be selected where new modules reside.
Developers modules can be added directly from this folder or modules
can be added from another specified locaton.
The checkbox decides if package metadata should be generated every time.
Disable this option if you are transforming your R-package to a JASP Module
or simply want to keep manual changes to DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.")
