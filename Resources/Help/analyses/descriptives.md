Descriptives
============

Descriptives allows you to obtain basic descriptive statistics, histograms and density plots, correlation plots, boxplots, and frequency tables.

Default Options
-------
### Statistics:
- Central Tendency (only for continuous variables):
  - Mean: Arithmetic mean of the data points
- Dispersion (only for continuous variables):
  - Std. deviation: Standard deviation of the data points
  - Minimum: Minimum value of the data points
  - Maximum: Maximum value of the data points

Default Output
-------
### Descriptive Statistics:
- Valid: Number of valid cases
- Missing: Number of missing values
- Mean: Arithmetic mean of the data points
- Std. Deviation: Standard deviation of the data points
- Minimum: Minimum value of the data points
- Maximum: Maximum value of the data points

Additional Options
------------------
### Display Frequency Tables (nominal and ordinal variables):
- Displays a frequency table for each variable

### Plots:
- Distribution Plots:
  - For continuous variables, displays a histogram and the fit of a nonparametric density estimator
  - For nominal and ordinal variables, displays a frequency distribution
- Correlation Plot:
  - For continuous variables, displays histograms, density plots, and scatterplots
- Boxplots:
  - For continuous variables, displays a boxplot.
  - Optionally, the outliers are labelled. Outliers are based on the interquartile range (IQR), i.e., [25th Quartile] - 1.5 × IQR and [75th Quartile] + 1.5 × IQR.
  - Can also display in color.
  - Has selectable boxplot, violin, and jitter elements for displaying the distribution of the data.
  - Can be split by a categorical variable such as experimental condition.

### Statistics (only for continuous variables):
- Percentile Values:
  - Quartiles: Displays the 25th, 50th, and 75th quartile of the data points
  - Cut points for x equal groups: Displays the cut points that divide the data into x equal groups; default is 4 equal groups
  - Percentiles: Displays the xth percentile; percentile values must be separated by comma
- Central Tendency:
  - Median: Median of the data points
  - Mode: Mode of the data points; if more than one mode exists, only the first is reported
  - Sum: Sum of the data points
- Dispersion:
  - Variance: Variance of the data points
  - Range: Range of the data points; i.e., Maximum-Minimum
  - S.E. Mean: Standard error of the mean
- Distribution:
  -Skewness: Skew of the distribution of the data points
  -Kurtosis: Kurtosis of the distribution of the data points

Additional Output
------------------
### Display Distribution Plots:
- For continuous variables, displays a histogram and the fit of a nonparametric density estimator
- For nominal and ordinal variables, displays a frequency distribution

### Display Correlation Plot:
- Displays a matrix of plots between continuous variables, with scatterplots between the variables in the off-diagonal entries, and histograms and density plots in the diagonal entries.
 The line represents the fit of a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th order polynomial (the selection is based on the Bayesian information criterion; Schwarz, 1978).

### Display Boxplots:
- For continuous variables, displays a boxplot. Optionally, the outliers are labelled. Outliers are based on the interquartile range (IQR), i.e., [25th Quartile] - 1.5 × IQR and [75th Quartile] + 1.5 × IQR. Can also display in color, and has selectable boxplot, violin, and jitter elements for displaying the distribution of the data. This can be split by a categorical variable such as experimental condition.

### Display Frequency Tables (nominal and ordinal variables):
- Displays a frequency table for each variable
  - Frequency: Frequency of occurrence of each value
  - Percent: Percentage of occurrence of each value
  - Valid Percent: Valid percentage of occurrence of each value
  - Cumulative Percent: Cumulative percentage

### Descriptive Statistics:
  - Std. Error of Mean: Standard error of the mean
  - Median: Median of the data points
  - Mode: Mode of the data points
  - Variance: Variance of the data points
  - Skewness: Skew of the distribution of the data points
  - Std. Error of Skewness: Standard error of the skewness
  - Kurtosis: Kurtosis of the distribution of the data points
  - Std. Error of Kurtosis: Standard error of kurtosis
  - Range: Range of the data points
  - Sum: Sum of the data points
  - Quartiles: 25th, 50th, and 75th quartile of the data points
  - Cut points for x equal groups: Cut points that divide the data into x equal groups
  - Percentiles: Displays the xth percentiles
