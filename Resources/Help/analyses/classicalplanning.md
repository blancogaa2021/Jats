Planning
==========================

An auditor's job is to make a jugement regarding the fairness of the presented transactions in a population, and judge if the population contains errors that are material (lower than materiality). Sometimes, an auditor needs to calculate the required sample size beforehand without having access to the raw population data. In this case, the auditor can use the *planning* analysis together with the population's summary statistics (total size and value) to calculate how many samples need to be evaluated in order to meet a certain confidence in their judgement. The frequentist *planning* analysis may use the risk assessments from the *audit risk model* to adjust the required riks of finding material errors.

*Note:* When you have access to the raw population data you may want to use the *audit workflow*, an analysis that guides you through the audit process.

----

Default options
-------
### Population materiality:
- Absolute: Enter your population materiality as a monetary value.
- Relative: Enter your population materiality as a percentage relative to the total value.

### Population
- Size: The total number of observations in the total population.
- Value: The total value of the population in monetary units.

### Audit Risk
- Confidence: The confidence level of the analysis. The confidence level equals the audit risk of the audit.

----

Advanced options
-------

### Inherent risk and control risk:
- High: 100%
- Medium: 60%
- Low: 50%

When both risk assessments are set to High (100%) the audit risk model is not used to adjust the detection risk.

### Expected errors:
- Absolute: Enter your expected errors as a monetary value (e.g., $1.000 in a total balance of $1.000.000).
- Relative: Enter your expected errors as a percentage relative to the total size of the selection.

### Explanatory text:
- Enables explanatory text throughout the workflow to help you interpret the statistical results and procedure.

### Planning distribution:
- Poisson: The poisson distribution for broken taints (AICPA, 2017).
- Binomial: The infinite population binomial distribution for complete taints.
- Hypergeometric: The finite population hypergeometric distribution for complete taints.

Default Output
-------

### Planning summary
- Materiality: The population materiality.
- Inherent risk: Risk assessment for the inherent risk.
- Control risk: Risk assessment for the control risk.
- Expected errors: The number of expected errors in the selection.
- Required sample size: The sample size that is required for your population statement.
