Summary Statistics Bayesian Independent samples T-Test
===

This function allows you to compute Bayes factor corresponding to an independent groups t-test using the classical *t* statistic. The null hypothesis states that the population means of two independent groups are equal. This Bayesian assessment can be executed in the absence of the raw data.

### Assumptions
- The observations in both groups are a random sample from the population
- The dependent variable is normally distributed in both populations
- The population variances in the two groups are homogeneous

### Input
---
#### Assignment Box
- *t*: t-Statistic
- *Group 1 size*
- *Group 2 size*

#### Alt. Hypothesis
- *Group 1 &ne; Group 2*: Two-sided alternative hypothesis that the population means are equal
- *Group 1 &gt; Group 2*: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean of Group one is larger than the population mean of Group two
- *Group 1 &lt; Group 2*: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean of Group one is smaller than the population mean of Group two

#### Bayes Factor
- *BF10*: Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis
- *BF01*: Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis
- *Log(BF10)*: Natural logarithm of BF10

#### Plots
- *Prior and posterior*: Displays the prior (dashed line) and posterior (solid line) density of the effect size under the alternative hypothesis; the gray circles represent the height of the prior and the posterior density at effect size delta = 0. The horizontal solid line represents the width of the 95% credible interval of the posterior.
  - Additional info: Adds the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; adds a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; adds the median and the 95% credible interval of the posterior density of the effect size
- *Bayes factor robustness check*: Displays the Bayes factor as a function of the width of the Cauchy prior on effect size. The scale of the Cauchy prior is varied between 0 and 1.5 (between 0 and 2 if user prior width is greater than 1.5), creating progressively more uninformative priors.

### Prior
- **Standardized effect size**
  - Default
    - *Cauchy*: Scale of the Cauchy prior density on effect size under the alternative hypothesis; the default is 0.707
  - Informed
    - *Cauchy*: Scale and location
    - *Normal*: Mean and Standard deviation
    - *Student's t*: Scale, Location and Degrees of freedom (df)

- **Raw effect size (Dienes)**
  - *Half-Normal*: Standard deviation
  - *Normal*: Mean and Standard deviation
  - *Uniform*: Lower and Upper bounds

### Output
---
- **Bayes factor**
  - BF+0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean is larger than the test value.
  - BF-0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean is smaller than the test value.
  - BF0+: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean is larger than the test value.
  - BF0-: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that that the population mean is smaller than the test value.
- **error %**: The error of the Gaussian quadrature integration routine used for the computation of the Bayes factor.
- **p**: p-value corresponding to t-statistic.
