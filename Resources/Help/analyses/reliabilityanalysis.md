## Reliability analysis

Additional documentation will be available in future releases of JASP.

### Options
#### Scale statistics
- McDonald's w
- Cronbach's alpha
  - Unstandardized
  - Standardized
- Gutmann's lambda 6
- Greatest lower bound
- Average interitem correlation
- Mean: Arithmetic mean of the data points
- Standard deviation: Standard deviation of the data points

#### Individual item statistics
Statistics for individual items.
- McDonald's w
- Cronbach's alpha: The most common measure of scale reliability.
- Gutmann's lambda 6
- Mean: Arithmetic mean of the data points
- Standard deviation: Standard deviation of the data points
- Item-rest correlation: The item-rest correlation indicates how the item correlates with the sum of the rest of the items.

#### Reverse-scaled items
- Normal-scaled items
- Reverse-scaled items

#### Missing values
### Missing Values:
 - Exclude cases analysis by analysis: In case of multiple correlations tests within a single analysis, each test will be conducted using all cases with valid data for the variables for the particular test.
 Sample sizes may therefore vary across the tests.
 - Exclude cases listwise: In case of multiple correlation tests within a single analysis, each test will be conducted using only cases with valid data for all variables. Sample size is therefore constant across the tests.

#### Confidence interval
- Cronbach's alpha  (analytical)
  - Confidence: default is 95%
