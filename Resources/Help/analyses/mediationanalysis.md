Mediation analysis
============

Mediation analysis with potentially multiple predictors, multiple mediators, multiple outcomes, and correction for multiple confounders.

### Details about testing indirect effects
Testing whether an indirect effect exists is best done via the "Bootstrap" option under Options > Confidence Intervals > Methods > Bootstrap. The confidence intervals are then computed using the percentile method as suggested by Biesanz, Falk, and Savalei (2010).
