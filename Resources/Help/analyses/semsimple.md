Structural Equation Modeling
==========================

Perform structural equation modeling (SEM) using `lavaan` (Rosseel, 2012). Go to lavaan.org for tutorials on the model syntax. See also Kline (2015).

For additional reading, see https://osf.io/xkg3j/ for an introduction to SEM in JASP, by Burger & Tanis.
