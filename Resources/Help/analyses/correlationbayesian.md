Bayesian Correlation Matrix
===

The Bayesian Correlation Matrix allows estimation of the population correlation, as well as testing the null hypothesis that the population correlation between pairs of variables equals 0. All possible pairs of the specified variables are analyzed.

### Assumptions (Pearson's rho)
- Continuous variables
- The data are a random sample from the population
- The pairs of variables follow a bivariate normal distribution in the population
- The relationship between the pairs of variables is linear

### Assumptions (Kendall's tau)
- Ordinal or continuous variables
- The data are a random sample from the population
- The relationship between the pairs of variables is monotonic

### Input
---

#### Correlation Coefficient
- Pearson's rho: Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient. 
- Kendall's tau-b: Kendall's tau-b rank-order correlation coefficient to quantify the monotonic association between two variables.

#### Alt. Hypothesis
- Correlated: Two-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation does not equal 0.
- Correlated positively: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is greater than 0.
- Correlated negatively: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0.

#### Bayes Factor
- BF<sub>10</sub>: By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis. This option is selected by default.
- BF<sub>01</sub> : By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis. This is equal to 1/BF<sub>10</sub>.
- Log(BF<sub>10</sub>) : By selecting this option, the natural logarithm of BF<sub>10</sub>, BF<sub>m</sub>, BF<sub>Inclusion</sub>, BF<sub>10, U</sub> will be displayed in the output.

#### Additional Options
  - Report Bayes factors: Report Bayes factor for each test.
  - Flag supported correlations: Indicate which correlation coefficients yield Bayes factors greater than 10, 30, and 100. 
  - Credible intervals: Display central 95% credible intervals for the correlation coefficient.

#### Plots
- Correlation matrix: Display a grid of scatterplots for each possible combination of the selected variables. These are placed above the diagonal.
  - Densities for variables: Display histogram and the corresponding density plot for each variable. These are placed on the diagonal.
  - Posteriors under H<sub>1</sub>: Display posterior distribution of the correlation coefficient for each possible combination of the selected variables. These are placed below the diagonal.
  
#### Prior
- Stretched beta prior width: Width of the scaled beta distribution on the correlation under the alterative hypothesis; default is 1. The lower this value, the more concentrated the prior density is around 0. Value must be between 0 and 2.

### Options
- Missing values: 
  - Exclude cases pairwise
  - Exclude cases listwise

### Output

#### Bayesian Correlation Table
- Pearson's r: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.
- Kendall's tau: Kendall's rank correlation coefficient.
- BF10 (or BF01): Bayes factor. If one-sided test is requested:
  - BF+0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is higher than 0.
  - BF-0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0.
  - BF0+: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is higher than 0.
  - BF0-: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0.
- Credible interval: Central credible intervals for the correlation coefficient.

- Flag supported correlations: Correlations that are supported to the Bayes factor are marked with (see Jeffreys (1961) for evidence categories).
  - *BF > 10 if the data are at least 10 times more likely under the chosen hypothesis (see Hypothesis above).
  - **BF > 30 if the data are at least 30 times more likely under the chosen hypothesis (see Hypothesis above).
  - ***BF > 100 if the data are at least 100 times more likely under the chosen hypothesis (see Hypothesis above).

#### Correlation Plot
- Correlation Matrix: Displays a (matrix of) scatterplot(s) between the variables (in the upper off-diagonal entries of the matrix). The black line represents the least-square regression line.
    - Densities for variables: Displays a histogram and the corresponding density plot for each variable in the diagonal entries of the matrix.
    - Posteriors under H1: Displays density plot(s) of the posterior of the correlation(s) under the alternative hypothesis in the lower off-diagonal entries of the matrix.
