<h1>How to use the R Filter</h1>

<p>
	Using the R filter gives you the opportunity to write custom filters for your data.
	You can combine this easily with the results from the other filters, that is, those selected in the variable window or made in the easy filter.
	In fact, you can easily observe the code that is generated by those other filters in the top read-only textbox that starts with <span class="code">generatedFilter &lt;-</span>.
</p>

<p>
	To refer to your data simply enter the columnname in the code-window, JASP will make sure that it refers to the correct data. 
	If your columnname contains spaces you must enter these as well.
</p>

<p>
	Some examples, which will of course only work if your data contains those columns, should serve to clarify:
	<ul>
			<li>
					<b>Filtering the opposite of the easy-filter and label-selection</b>
					<p class="code">!generatedFilter</p>
			</li>
			<li>
					<b>Filtering on Gender and TestScore</b>
					<p class="code">Gender == "Female" & TestScore > 5</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<b>Filtering on Gender and TestScore while taking into account easy-filter and label-selection</b>
					<p class="code">generatedFilter & Gender == "Female" & TestScore > 5</p>
			</li>
	</ul>
</p>
