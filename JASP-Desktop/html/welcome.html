		<h1>Welcome to JASP!</h1>
		<p>Hi and welcome to JASP, a fresh and new way to do statistics that we're sure you'll like.</p>
		<p>
			JASP aims to be a complete and full featured alternative to SPSS, and it's well on its way there!
			In fact, it aims to be a lot more than SPSS, which is why it implements some of the latest Bayesian
			analyses. So load up a data file, and take a look.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also remember, this is an early preview release and
			there are a number of features missing. So if it doesn't do all you need today, then check back
			tomorrow; JASP is being developed at break-neck speed!
