# Guideline for JASP translators

## Introduction
In this document we keep track of some general guidelines that translators of JASP should follow during the tanslation process. This is an ongoing process and this document should help to maintain consistancy. 
##  Translation of statistical terms
1. Weblate has the functionality of defining glossaries. Each project can have an assigned glossary for any language as a shorthand for storing terminology. Consistency is more easily maintained this way. If a term is defined in the Weblate glossery in its proper context this definition should be used. Definitions defined in the glossery can be exported and imported.
2. When in doubt, please use the statistical terms as they occur in introductory statistics textbooks and courses in your language. We would like users to recognize the terms that are used. If you deem this useful you can mention alternative terms in the help file. 
3. If in doubt, a guideline could be to do for the language you translate a google-scholar search for different terms you are doubting.
